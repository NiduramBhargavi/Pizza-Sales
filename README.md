# Pizza-Sales
This project involved analyzing Pizza Hut sales data using SQL and Excel. SQL was used for data extraction and cleaning, while Excel enabled in-depth analysis through pivot tables and dashboards. I automated reporting with Power Query, providing actionable insights on sales trends, product performance, and profitability.
